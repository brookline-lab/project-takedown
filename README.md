Summary: Goals of the project, and an introduction to the author

## Project Takedown
Project Takedown was an idea conceived in 2020 with the goal of creating short, easy to read, documentation on a wide range of topics related to computer power usage with a strong focus on cyber security.

The Project includes quick reference guides for programming and scripting languages, write-ups for some popular CTF games, and notes on best practices for personal computer security.



### Documentation guidelines:

Articles on the subject of programming languages will present either a real world problem or a notable challenge from a CTF game.  These articles do not aim to replace or replicate "Hello World" style lessons.

After action reports or CTF write-ups are written to be spoiler free where possible.

Notes may take on more of a blog-style format and contain the author's personal opinions.
